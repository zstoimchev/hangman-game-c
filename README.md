# Hangman Game in C programming language
This is terminal-based hangman game. You have 6 moves (as usual), and the goal is to guess the unknown word.

To run the game, oper "src" as working directory, and then:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;On Unix:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;gcc main.c - to build the file.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;./a.out&emsp;&emsp;- to run the game.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;On Windows:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;gcc main.c&emsp;&emsp;- to build the file<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;output-main.c - to run the fame

This image is test-run made by me, as for demonstration:

Good luck playing! :)
